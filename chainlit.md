### Answer vs. Search

Don't just get the weather. Ask what you really want to know and let me answer your underlying question.

### 📝 Examples

* `Should I wear a jacket tonight in Denver?`
* `I'm traveling to Seattle on Monday. Should I bring an umbrella?`
* `Which day is better for a hike this weekend in Leadville?`

### ⛔ Limitations

* **Location Unaware** I don't know where you are, so tell me the location you're interested in.
* **No Memory** I don't currently have memory. Please include the location in every message.
* **No International Support** I'm powered by the [National Weather Service](https://www.weather.gov/), so I can only answer questions about the United States.
* **7 Day Forecast** I can only answer questions about the next 7 days.
