### Answer vs Search

Don't just get the weather. Ask what you really want to know and let me answer your underlying question.

### ‚õî Limitations

* **Location Unaware** I don't know where you are, so tell me the location you're interested in.
* **No International Support** I'm powered by the [National Weather Service](https://www.weather.gov/), so I can only answer questions about the United States.
* **7 Day Forecast** I can only answer questions about the next 7 days.

üìù Here are some examples to get you started, or enter whatever you like!
